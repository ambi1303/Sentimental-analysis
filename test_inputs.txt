I absolutely love waiting in traffic for two hours.
Oh great, another Monday. Just what I needed.
Yeah, because waking up at 5 AM is so relaxing.
The meeting is scheduled for 2 PM.
The weather is beautiful today.
This movie was absolutely terrible.
I'm so happy to be working overtime on weekends.
What a wonderful surprise to find my car with a flat tire.
The food at this restaurant is amazing!
I can't believe how slow this internet connection is.
